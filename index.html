                <p id="introduction"><strong>Jacques Torres</strong> (<strong>born June 14, 1959</strong>) is a pastry
                    chef and
                    chocolatier. Torres is a

                    International Culinary Center community, as Dean of Pastry Arts as well as holding pastry
                    demonstrations.</p>
                <p>Torres was born in Algiers and grew up in Bandol, a fishing village in the South of France.
                    When Torres was 15 years old, he began an apprenticeship at a small pastry shop and completed his
                    apprenticeship requirements in two years, graduating first in his class. In <strong>1980</strong> he
                    began working
                    with two-star Michelin chef Jacques Maximin at the Hotel Negresco. During that time, Torres also
                    attended culinary school to earn a Master Pastry Chef degree. Next he taught pastry courses at a
                    culinary school in Cannes from <strong>1983</strong> to <strong>1986</strong>. In
                    <strong>1986</strong>, Torres was the youngest person to ever win
                    the Meilleur Ouvrier Patissier de France competition. Torres moved to the United States, and in
                    <strong>1988</strong> he served as the Corporate Pastry Chef for the Ritz Carlton Hotel Company
                    before moving on to
                    Le Cirque, where he worked for 11 years as Executive Pastry Chef. Torres joined the faculty of
                    the International Culinary Center in <strong>1993</strong>, and after designing the Classic Pastry
                    Arts Curriculum in
                    <strong>1996</strong>, he became the school's Dean of Pastry Arts. In <strong>2000</strong> Torres
                    left Le Cirque to open a
                    chocolate factory and retail shop in Brooklyn, New York. Currently there are eight Jacques Torres
                    shops, including one chocolate factory in the Brooklyn Army Terminal and an ice cream shop in Grand
                    Central Terminal. In March <strong>2017</strong> Jacques opened New York City's first chocolate
                    museum, named
                    Choco-Story New York. The 5000sq. ft. museum opened at the site of his flagship store in Manhattan.

                    his chocolate
                    factory. Khoei owned a chocolate shop, Madame Chocolat, in Beverly Hills, California. Their son,
                    Pierre, was born on <strong>August 19 2016</strong>. and the family currently resides in New York
